This phylogeny shows the evolutionary relationships of SARS-CoV-2 viruses from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic focusing on Mindanao.

The sequences obtained from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) are used in this visualization.

This is an ongoing initiative of the Center of Applied Modeling, Data Analytics, and Bioinformatics for Decision Support Systems in Health (AMDABIDSS-HEALTH) of the University of the Philippines Mindanao.

Disclamer: The phylogeographic analysis of Mindanao-focused SARS-CoV-2 cannot be performed since it necessitates well representation of samples globally for appropriate transmission context. This is due to the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2, whereas the phylogeographic analysis is better applicable to bacteria or other slow-evolving viruses.
